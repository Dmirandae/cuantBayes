# Gibbs Sampling: A Markov Chain Approach

## Introduction to Gibbs Sampling

- Basic version as a special case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.
- Extended versions serve as a general framework for sampling from a set of variables.
- Integration with Metropolis–Hastings or slice sampling for enhanced flexibility.

## Applicability of Gibbs Sampling

- Suitable when the joint distribution is not explicitly known or challenging to sample directly.
- Assumes known conditional distributions of variables, making sampling feasible.
- Useful for sampling from a large set of variables sequentially.

## Gibbs Sampling Algorithm

- Generates samples from each variable in turn, conditioned on the current values of other variables.
- Sequential process to sample each variable or group of variables.
- The sequence of samples forms a Markov chain.

## Gibbs: Sampling Procedure Algorithm

1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin with an initial value \( $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$ \).

2. **Iterative Sampling:**
   - Obtain \( k \) samples of \( $\mathbf{X}$ \) through sequential conditional sampling.
   - Update each component based on conditional distributions.
   - Use values from the previous sample for certain components.

3. **Repeat:**
   - Iterate the above step \( k \) times.
