# The Set of All Possible Events
- **Overview of the Concept:**
  - A fundamental concept in probability theory.
  - Represents all potential outcomes or occurrences in an experiment or situation.
- **Significance in Probability Theory:**
  - Forms the sample space for a given experiment.
  - Essential for defining probabilities of specific events.

---

# Example: Coin Toss
- Consider the experiment of tossing a fair coin.
- The set of all possible events: {Heads, Tails}.
- Each outcome in the set is a possible event.

---

# Example: Rolling a Die
- Experiment: Rolling a six-sided die.
- The set of all possible events: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
- Each face of the die represents a possible event.

- Illustration using coin flips.
- Linking the concept to real-world scenarios.

---

# Probability: Outside or Inside the Head
- Outside the head: Long-run relative frequency.
- Inside the head: Subjective belief.
- Probabilities assign numbers to possibilities.

---

# Outside the Head: Long-run Relative Frequency
- Simulating a long-run relative frequency.
- Deriving a long-run relative frequency.

---

# Inside the Head: Subjective Belief
- Calibrating a subjective belief by preferences.
- Describing a subjective belief mathematically.

---

# Probabilities Assign Numbers to Possibilities
- Probabilities are assigned to different outcomes to quantify uncertainty.
- The assignment of probabilities is a fundamental concept in probability theory.

---

# Understanding How Probabilities Are Assigned
- Probabilities are numerical measures representing the likelihood of events.
- Assigning probabilities involves assessing the chance of different outcomes.
- Probabilities are expressed as values between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility, 1 indicates certainty, and values in between represent varying degrees of likelihood.

---

# Example: Coin Toss
- Consider a fair coin toss.
- There are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).
- Since the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads is 0.5, and the probability of getting tails is also 0.5.

---

# Example: Rolling a Six-sided Die
- Suppose you roll a standard six-sided die.
- Each face has an equal chance of landing face up.
- The probability of rolling a specific number, say 3, is \( \frac{1}{6} \) because there are six possible outcomes.

---

# Example: Drawing a Card from a Deck
- Consider drawing a single card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
- The probability of drawing an Ace is \( \frac{4}{52} \) since there are four Aces in the deck.
- The probability of drawing a red card is \( \frac{26}{52} \) since half of the cards are red.
