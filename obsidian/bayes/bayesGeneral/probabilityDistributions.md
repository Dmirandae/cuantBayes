# Continuous Distributions: Rendezvous with Density
- Probability density function for continuous distributions.
- Definition of probability density: It is the ratio of probability mass over interval width.
- Examples:
  - Uniform distribution.
  - Exponential distribution.
  - Normal distribution.

# Properties of Probability Density Functions
- Understanding the properties that characterize probability density functions.
- Emphasis on normalization and non-negativity.

---

# The Normal Probability Density Function
- Special focus on the normal distribution.
- Shape, mean, and standard deviation.
- Real-world examples: Height, IQ scores.

---

# Mean and Variance of a Distribution
- Mean as minimized variance.

---

# Highest Density Interval (HDI)
- Understanding the concept of HDI.

---

# Concept of HDI
- It provides a range of values within which a specified portion of the probability density function lies.

---

# Why HDI Matters
- HDI is valuable for summarizing uncertainty about a parameter.
- It's particularly useful when dealing with complex distributions or posterior distributions from Bayesian analysis.

---

# Calculating HDI
- HDI is often calculated numerically using methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
- It represents the narrowest interval that contains a certain predefined probability mass.

---

# Interpretation of HDI
- The width of the HDI reflects the precision of our knowledge about the parameter.
- A narrow HDI indicates more precise estimation, while a wider HDI suggests greater uncertainty.
