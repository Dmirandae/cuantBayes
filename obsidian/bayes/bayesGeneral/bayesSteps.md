# Bayesian Analysis Steps: Krushcke, 2015

## 1: Identify Relevant Data

- Determine measurement scales.
- Identify predictor and response variables.

## 2: Define Descriptive Model

- Choose a mathematical form for the model.
- Ensure parameters align with theoretical goals.

## 3: Specify Prior Distribution

- Obtain audience approval for the prior.
- Ensure the prior reflects prior knowledge.

## 4: Bayesian Inference

- Use data to update beliefs (Bayesian inference).
- Interpret the posterior distribution.

## 5: Posterior Predictive Check

- Verify that posterior predictions match observed data.
- Consider alternative descriptive models if needed.

## Steps in Bayesian Data Analysis: Gelman et al. 2017/20

1. **Setting up a Full Probability Model**
   - Joint probability distribution for all observable and unobservable quantities.
   - Consistent with knowledge about the scientific problem and data collection process.

2. **Conditioning on Observed Data**
   - Calculate and interpret the posterior distribution.
   - Conditional probability distribution of unobserved quantities given the observed data.

3. **Evaluating Model Fit and Implications**
   - Assess how well the model fits the data.
   - Examine the reasonability of substantive conclusions.
   - Evaluate sensitivity to modeling assumptions from step 1.
